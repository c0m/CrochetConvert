# CrochetConvert
CrochetConvert is webapp made with Blazor for converting UK and US crocheting terminology. Some terms are shared, but others are different in confusing ways. This webapp lets you input instructions in UK or US and recieve the respective translated instructions. 

The terminology differs in these places:

| US  | UK |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| slip stitch (ss/sl st)  | slip stitch (ss)  |
| single crochet (sc)  | double crochet (dc) |
| half double crochet (hdc) | half treble (htr) |
| double crochet (dc)  | single crochet/treble (tr) |
| half treble (htr)  | half double (hdc)  |
| treble (tr)  | double (dtr) |
| double treble (dtr)  | triple treble (trtr)  |
| yarn over (yo) | yarn over hook (yoh)
| gauge | tension |


As you can see in the table, some terms only exist in one but not the other, or one term could mean something different in US or vice versa. This is confusing and a person may understandably want all their instructions in one or the other.
